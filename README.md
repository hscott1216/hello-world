First Github repository 

Hello everyone, 
So this is kind of funny, but I found Git and Github because I like to play roleplaying games. 
The Covid-19 pandemic forced our game to go online, and Bob's your Uncle, I find myself wanting to program javaScript and C#!

But then it gets wild. 
I have for the past 15 yrs working in hospitality, and well, you all know how well that went in 2020. 
A friend from work told me I should really look into working with computers because  I have always been interested. I have been responsible for everything tec related at every unit I have ever managed or worked. 
That's all it took, and I found myself changing my life and career to pursue Cybersecurity. Which brings me here. 
Creating a repository to hold the programs I create in Python to start. 
The world can be a crazy, crazy place, and picking up the pieces to form a new picture, maybe all that we can do. 

 Hugh
