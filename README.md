hello-world

First Github repository 

Hello everyone, 
so this is kind of funny, but I found Git and Github because I like to to play roleplaying games. 
The Covid-19 pandedmic forced our game to go online and bob your uncle I find myself wanting to program javaScript and C#!

But then it get wild. 
I have for the past 15 yrs worked in hospiutality, and well you all know how well thaat went in 2020. 
A friend from work told me I should really look into working with computer, because  I have always been interested, 
and I have manageed the everything tec related at unit i have evver managed or worked. 
thats all it took, an I found my self changeing my life and carrer to pursue a Cyber security. Which brings me here. 
Creatign a repository to hold the programs I create in Python to start. 
The world can be a crazy crazy place, and picking up the pieces to form a new picture maybe all that we can do. 

 Hugh
